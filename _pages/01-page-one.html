  <p>[Today's Date]</p>
  <p>Dear [Factory Name]:</p>
  <p>NBCUniversal (NBCU) and its employees have created an asset of incalculable value -- the company’s worldwide reputation for integrity and enterprise of respectable business practices. NBCU’s quest for competitive excellence begins and ends with its unyielding commitment to ethical conduct.</p>
  <p>We also expect and require ethical conduct from all of our suppliers. Your strong commitment in this regard is a requirement for being an NBCU supplier and is the foundation for our mutually beneficial business relationship.</p>
  <p>I am pleased to inform you that you have been conditionally approved based on successfully closing or downgrading to yellow flag status, all red flagged findings set forth in the attached audit report dated as of [Audit Report Date]. We appreciate your demonstrated commitment to the program and encourage you to continue your efforts in this regard.</p>
  <p>As part of your continuing relationship with NBCU, this conditional approval is subject to your ongoing cooperation and support towards closing all remaining open yellow flagged findings within twelve (12) months of your last audit date ([Actual Audit Date]). Should any audit findings remain open at that time or follow-up become unsuccessful, this conditional approval is subject to being overturned. At that time, I will expect all audit findings to have been addressed and closed, and that you will have kept up to date with your permits and local regulations and standards as we do re-audit yearly. However, as an incentive, if you successfully close all audit findings within twelve (12) months of your last audit date, and due to your overall audit score being [Audit Score]% compliant, we will instead extend your next audit to be scheduled eighteen (18) OR twenty-four (24) months from your last audit date.</p>
  <p><strong>OR:</strong> As part of your continuing relationship with NBCU, this conditional approval is subject to your ongoing cooperation and support towards closing all remaining open yellow flagged findings within twelve (12) months of your last audit date ([Actual Audit Date]). Should any audit findings remain open at that time or follow-up become unsuccessful, this conditional approval is subject to being overturned.  You will also need to keep up with all permits and regulations and laws as we do re-audit yearly until an overall compliance score of 85% or higher has been reached. Your current score is [Audit Score]%.</p>
  <p>Please note that during this period, NBCU reserves the right to conduct an on-site audit or spot check if required due to possible changes in business needs or the status of your factory. Upon the expiration of the approval period granted herein, the factory will need to be re-audited and re-approved by NBCU in order to maintain its approved supplier status and continue production of NBCU-branded product.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to discuss them with me so that we can work together to formulate an acceptable plan for compliance with these standards.</p>
  <p>Congratulations!</p>
  <p>Global Brand Standards, Legal<br />NBCUniversal | Universal Brand Development</p>
